**Technologies to be Used:** 

Design a complex network topology in which the terminologies (i.e.Inter Vlan Routing, Router 
As a Stick, sub-netting, Telnet, Security (ACL), Eth-Trunk, Static Route, RIP, STP, VLAN, DHCP, 
and FTP) must be used. 

***Problem Statement:***

Build a complex network topology using eNSP simulator where the above said terminologies 
are used. You may add your assumptions. 

**Problem Description:**

The goal is to design and implement a comprehensive network topology using the Enterprise 
Network Simulation Platform (eNSP) that caters to the needs of a government building 
hosting multiple departments, including Administration, Finance, Human Resources, IT, 
Public Relations, and Security. This network must incorporate the following key networking 
elements:
**1. Subnetting:** Logical division of the network to ensure isolation and efficient IP address management for each department.

**2. Telnet:** Remote management of routers and switches with secure access controls.

**3. Access Control Lists (ACLs):** Implementation of security policies to control access between departments.

**4. Eth-Trunk (LACP based):** Link aggregation to provide redundancy and load balancing between switches.

**5. Static Routes:** Manual routing entries to ensure proper packet delivery across different subnets.

**6. RIP (Routing Information Protocol):** Dynamic routing protocol to facilitate automatic route updates and simplify network management.

**7. STP (Spanning Tree Protocol) Conversion:** Prevention of network loops and ensuring a loop-free topology.

**8. VLAN (Router on a Stick):** VLAN segmentation and inter-VLAN routing to manage broadcast domains and improve network performance.

**9. DHCP:** Dynamic IP address allocation for devices within the network.

**10. FTP:** Secure file transfer within the network for various departmental needs.
